This assignment is not done yet. I am stuck. In theory, I know what I need to do. Create an empty array, save the searched cities into that array, stringify the array into local storage. then add a function at the beginning of the page to pull the saved data out and display it, or if there is no array saved in local storage (ie the first time a user visits) to ignore that step and move on. However, I have been so psychologically stressed by this assignment on top of project 1 that while I know in theory what I am able to do, I find myself metaphorically paralyzed when I actually try to go to write code. As such, I'm putting it aside for now so that my work on Project 1 does not suffer due to stress accumulation. I will return to this assignment when I have both the time, and am mentally in a good place, to be able to finish it.
